# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My first draft:
This app is designed to allow you to keep track of all the cool new things that are coming out. When your coworker tells you about an awesome new show they read about coming out this fall, here is where you keep track of it! When your friend mentions that the author you both love has a new release just before the holidays, the app reminds you to buy them a copy! When your favorite band releases tour dates, you'll know just when to go buy tickets. 

Instead of all this info being spread across websites and mailing lists and push notifications, now it's all in one place. It's a great way to remember what's coming up and enjoy that anticipation all the way up to the Next Big Thing!

Team version:
This app is designed to allow you to keep track of all the cool new things that are coming out. Instead of all this info being spread across websites and mailing lists and push notifications, we're proposing a central location for users to be able to find what they're looking for, and have a countdown for it as well! Since it'll be user based our customers will be able to not only save the items they find but he app can also suggest similar events that the user may be interested in also share friends and fellow fans!  

It's a great way to remember what's coming up and enjoy that anticipation all the way up to the Next Big Thing!
